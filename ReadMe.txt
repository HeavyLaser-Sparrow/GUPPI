GUPPI stands for General User Primary Peripheral Interface. It is used as a hub for scripts that will help me with day to day
activities on the computer. I can edit it by going to the GUPPI.py file. I can add more scripts by creating a new file in this 
directory and then importing its functionality into the GUPPY.py file.
